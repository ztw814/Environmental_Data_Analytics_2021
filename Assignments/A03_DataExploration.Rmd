## Set up your R session

1. Check your working directory, load necessary packages (tidyverse), and upload two datasets: the ECOTOX neonicotinoid dataset (ECOTOX_Neonicotinoids_Insects_raw.csv) and the Niwot Ridge NEON dataset for litter and woody debris (NEON_NIWO_Litter_massdata_2018-08_raw.csv). Name these datasets "Neonics" and "Litter", respectively. 
```{r,  message = FALSE}
getwd()
library(tidyverse)

Neonics <- read.csv("../Data/Raw/ECOTOX_Neonicotinoids_Insects_raw.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
Litter <- read.csv("../Data/Raw/NEON_NIWO_Litter_massdata_2018-08_raw.csv", stringsAsFactors = TRUE)
```

## Learn about your system

2. The neonicotinoid dataset was collected from the Environmental Protection Agency's ECOTOX Knowledgebase, a database for ecotoxicology research. Neonicotinoids are a class of insecticides used widely in agriculture. The dataset that has been pulled includes all studies published on insects. Why might we be interested in the ecotoxicologoy of neonicotinoids on insects? Feel free to do a brief internet search if you feel you need more background information. 

> Answer: Even though they are seen as pests, insects are an important part of an ecosystem.  Although insecticides may target specific species that truly are pests, they may also inadvertently kill other insects that play important roles in crop fertilization or ecosystem health. We might be interested in studying this to ensure that crop reproduction is not inadvertently harmed by insecticide use.

3. The Niwot Ridge litter and woody debris dataset was collected from the National Ecological Observatory Network, which collectively includes 81 aquatic and terrestrial sites across 20 ecoclimatic domains. 32 of these sites sample forest litter and woody debris, and we will focus on the Niwot Ridge long-term ecological research (LTER) station in Colorado. Why might we be interested in studying litter and woody debris that falls to the ground in forests? Feel free to do a brief internet search if you feel you need more background information. 

> Answer: Litter and woody debris is an important part of any forest ecosystem, providing habitat and food for some organisms, releasing nutrients into the soil as it decomposes, and helping with temperature regulation and moisture retention in the soil.  We might be interested in studying this in order to assess the health of a forest.

4. How is litter and woody debris sampled as part of the NEON network? Read the NEON_Litterfall_UserGuide.pdf document to learn more. List three pieces of salient information about the sampling methods here: 

> Answer: 
*One pair of traps (elevated and ground) was placed per 400 m2. Plots were located at a strategic distance from buildings or roads.
*The amount of vegetation determined the spatial placement of the plots: if there was lots of vegetation cover, plots were placed randomly.  If the vegetation cover was spottier, the plots were placed strategically in areas with cover.
*All ground traps were sampled only once per year but elevated traps were sampled more frequently (once every two weeks) at plots with deciduous vegetation versus evergreen vegetation (once every couple months).



## Obtain basic summaries of your data (Neonics)

5. What are the dimensions of the dataset?

```{r}
dim(Neonics) #4623 rows, 30 columns
```

6. Using the `summary` function on the "Effects" column, determine the most common effects that are studied. Why might these effects specifically be of interest?
```{r}
summary(Neonics$Effect)
```

> Answer: The most common effects are population and mortality.  Mortality would be of interest in determining whether the insecticide is effective or not, while population would be of interest to see how the distribution of plant or insect population changes with insecticide application, also as a measure of effectiveness.

7. Using the `summary` function, determine the six most commonly studied species in the dataset (common name). What do these species have in common, and why might they be of interest over other insects? Feel free to do a brief internet search for more information if needed.

```{r}
sort(summary(Neonics$Species.Common.Name))
```

> Answer: The most common species studied are the Honey Bee (667 observations), Parasitic Wasp (285), Buff Tailed Bumblebee (183), Carniolan Honey Bee (152), Bumble Bee (140), and Italian Honeybee (113).  The bee species are critical to study because they are essential crop pollinators, so any negative impact on their populations from insecticides would trickle down to crop success.  The parasitic wasp is an important species to study because it naturally controls the populations of other insects by laying eggs in them and killing them once the larvae hatch.

8. Concentrations are always a numeric value. What is the class of Conc.1..Author. in the dataset, and why is it not numeric?

```{r}
class(Neonics$Conc.1..Author.)
unique(Neonics$Conc.1..Author.)
```

> Answer: It's not numeric because some of the data include additional non-numeric characters like "/", "<", and letter abbreviations.



## Explore your data graphically (Neonics)

9. Using `geom_freqpoly`, generate a plot of the number of studies conducted by publication year. 
```{r}
ggplot(Neonics) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(x=Publication.Year), binwidth=1)
```

10. Reproduce the same graph but now add a color aesthetic so that different Test.Location are displayed as different colors.
```{r}
ggplot(Neonics) +
  geom_freqpoly(aes(x=Publication.Year, color = Test.Location), binwidth = 1)

```

Interpret this graph. What are the most common test locations, and do they differ over time?

> Answer: The most common test locations are natural field and lab locations.  These are the most common across the duration of the study, although natural field locations were more common than lab locations in the 1990s but became much less common after 2008. 

11. Create a bar graph of Endpoint counts. What are the two most common end points, and how are they defined? Consult the ECOTOX_CodeAppendix for more information. 

```{r}
ggplot(Neonics) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=Endpoint))
sort(table(Neonics$Endpoint))
```

> Answer: The most common endpoints are LOEL (1664 observations), which describes the lowest insecticide dose that produced results different from the control, and NOEL (1816 observations), which describes the highest insecticide dose administered before results different from the control were observed.

## Explore your data (Litter)

12. Determine the class of collectDate. Is it a date? If not, change to a date and confirm the new class of the variable. Using the `unique` function, determine which dates litter was sampled in August 2018. 
```{r}
class(Litter$collectDate) #character, not date
Litter$collectDate <- as.Date(Litter$collectDate, "%Y-%m-%d") #change to date format
class(Litter$collectDate) #now class is date

unique(Litter$collectDate)
```
> Answer: Litter was sampled on August 2, 2018 and August 30, 2018.

13. Using the `unique` function, determine how many plots were sampled at Niwot Ridge. How is the information obtained from `unique` different from that obtained from `summary`?

```{r}
unique(Litter$plotID)
summary(Litter$plotID)
```

> Answer: 12 plots were sampled at Niwot Ridge.  unique() returns each unique value within the column, whereas summary() returns only the length and class of the column.

14. Create a bar graph of functionalGroup counts. This shows you what type of litter is collected at the Niwot Ridge sites. Notice that litter types are fairly equally distributed across the Niwot Ridge sites.
```{r}
ggplot(Litter) +
  geom_bar(aes(x=functionalGroup))
```

15. Using `geom_boxplot` and `geom_violin`, create a boxplot and a violin plot of dryMass by functionalGroup. 
```{r}
ggplot(Litter) +
  geom_boxplot(aes(x=functionalGroup, y=dryMass))

ggplot(Litter) +
  geom_violin(aes(x=functionalGroup, y=dryMass))
```

Why is the boxplot a more effective visualization option than the violin plot in this case?

> Answer: The boxplot is more effective because dry mass is either very spread out within the functional group (ex. mixed, needles) or very bunched up (ex. seeds, leaves).  There isn't much in between in this dataset, and the violin plot isn't able to visualize that very well.

What type(s) of litter tend to have the highest biomass at these sites? 

> Answer: It seems that needles and twigs/branches tend to have the highest biomass overall.
